Build an Image Style Transfer Tool using CycleGANs

Introduction
This project aims to implement an image style transfer tool using CycleGANs (Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial Networks). CycleGAN is a type of unsupervised learning algorithm that can transfer the style of an image from one domain to another without the need for paired data. In this project, we'll use CycleGANs to transfer the style of images between different domains, such as turning photographs into paintings or converting images from day to night.

Installation
To run this project, you'll need the following dependencies:
Python 3.x
PyTorch
torchvision
NumPy
Matplotlib
